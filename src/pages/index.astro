      <div class="text-2xl">
        <p>
          Welcome to TitanX, a hyper-deflationary DeFi 3.0 ecosystem built from the ground up with no insiders, no
          pre-sales, and no compromises. 100% fair launch. 100% community-owned. Designed for long-term value.
        </p>
        <p>
          TitanX was born from a simple belief: DeFi should belong to the many, not the few. No venture capital. No
          privileged insiders. Just code, community, and unstoppable innovation. Build On TitanX (#BoT) is a new concept
          lived out on this page by ensuring that every particpant can find the knowledge they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re creating the world’s first hyper-deflationary, fully fair-launched DeFi ecosystem — one that empowers
          builders, rewards users, and restores trust in decentralized finance. If you believe in transparency,
          composability, and merit-based value — you’re in the right place.

          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What is TITANX, and why is it so unique?" open>
            <p>
              TITANX is a grassroots crypto ecosystem built around fairness, decentralization, and builder-first
              principles. No VCs, no premines—just open infrastructure, fair launches, and code-driven alignment between
              users and developers.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Why is $TITANX 'Hyper Deflationary'?">
            <p>
              $TITANX supply decreases over time via on-chain burn mechanics. Usage triggers burns, making the token
              scarcer as adoption grows. There's no inflation or emissions schedule—only deflation tied to ecosystem
              activity.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Why are so many builders attracted to building on $TITANX?">
            <p>
              TITANX gives builders full autonomy. No gatekeepers, no closed ecosystems. Smart contracts, tools, and
              rewards are open to all. Builders earn visibility and value by shipping real products—not by marketing or
              insider deals.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Where do I buy $TITANX?">
            <p>
              $TITANX is traded on decentralized exchanges. Use official sources to verify token contracts. Availability
              depends on the chain—no centralized listing, no custody risk, fully on-chain.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Why is the focus on fair launches so pronounced here?">
            <p>
              Fair launches prevent early insider advantage and align incentives with actual contributors. TITANX
              projects launch publicly, transparently, and without private allocations. Builders earn trust by
              delivering—not by pre-sale hype.
            </p>
          </AccordionItem>
          <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Where can I get more educated on $TITANX & its ecosystem?">
            <p>
              Start at <a href="https://titanx.win" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">titanx.win</a>. Read the
              docs, explore builder tools, and follow on-chain deployments. Education is open, public, and driven by
              contributors—not centralized marketing.
