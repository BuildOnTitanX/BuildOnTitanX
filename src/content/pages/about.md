    title: What is TitanX about and how does this page support its vision?
    subtitle:
      content: >-
        TitanX has a key idea inside: Projects support each other!


        All proper TitanX projects follow a couple of important rules and aim
        for deflating the TitanX supply and therefore push it more and more
        towards being hyper-deflationary by using its buy and burn functions.

        This page aims to support this vision by giving the community a platform
        to post long term content on. A platform which can easily be extended
        and build upon. A place where Ideas, Content and Code can be shared and
        easily be found by others.


        The page supports two styles for the content, one is more like the
        typically website with simple and good content elements, for general
        texts and informations. This part will be extendable and over time we
        can establish new and nice components to present the content nicely.
        Like maybe we want to show some thirdparty charts or even show our own
        data in a chart. But the main focus here should be the texts and ideas
        themself. We got other great sites already like our beloved and still
        far ahead: [Titanxhub.com](http://Titanxhub.com) . But don't miss out on
        [titanxinfo.com](http://titanxinfo.com) or
        [titanxutils.com](http://titanxutils.com) as well.


        The other part is focusing more on builders and developers. We extended
        the starlight documentation-tool by the Static-Site-Generator Astro with
        a need way to also write content by using our simple pages-cms for the
        content. This way we get a nice structure to extend the content by
        different participants but keep the same look and feel. Starlight is a
        powerful tool allowing to structure and present Content including Code
        in a nice way. Think of GitBook until this part is also online.
