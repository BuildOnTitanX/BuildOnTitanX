        ## The Tutorials

        The Tutorials are a direct part of this page and focus mainly on different articles about web3, DeFi, Blockchain in general. Also other related topics like discussing pros and cons of ideas like the Buy and Burn. Here you will find a wide range of topics all focusing on Cryptocurrencies and thoughts about modern and free money.


        The Tutorials should be a random mix of good and interesting articles about the Ethos and Philosophy behind Cryptocurrencies. Here we should write and read about topics like why decentralization is a key factor, why Bitcoin was and is such a game changer, how Ethereum went many important steps further and why we need an Ethos like it's lived in the TitanX ecosystem.

        ## The Docs

        The Documentation on the other hand is another page of is own, with it's own Navigation and a specific but detailed documentation style, to create deatiled articles about Building on TitanX. Here the concept of #BuildOnTitanX should be lived, discussed and taught.


        The Documentation is based on Astros Starlight and therefore a powerful place to write detailed articles about web3 and it's development. Here either the Builders look deeper into specific ideas an topics about DeFi-protocols or the development itself get discussed

        The articles in the docs should all aim to give deep insides into Blockchain/Web3 development. May it be the planing or the financing or the actual coding of a Project.
